```

## Dev Server
Ruby HTTP server on port 8080. Config in `.claude/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "envision-site",
  "runtimeExecutable": "ruby",
  "runtimeArgs": ["-run", "-e", "httpd", ".", "-p", "8080"],
  "port": 8080
}
```
**Note:** Python3 http.server does NOT work — Xcode Command Line Tools not installed. Use Ruby.

To view on phone: same Wi-Fi network, navigate to `http://<laptop-ip>:8080`.

## Git
- Remote: GitHub (`origin`)
- **Push command**: `git -c credential.helper= push` — bypasses macOS Keychain credential helper which caches stale tokens. Uses inline token auth instead.

## Homepage (index.html)

8 sections including decorative curve dividers (stripped down from earlier 10-section version):

1. **Navigation** — Fixed sticky nav with Inspire Change logo image (`Photos/Envision Logo - Inspire Change.png`, `filter: invert(1)`, 36px height) + hamburger only (no visible nav-links on homepage). Hamburger opens a slide-in dropdown panel from the right. Dropdown contains: audience links (Partner With Us, Launch Your Campaign, Join a Team Near You), divider, About Us, Meet the Team, Careers, FAQs, Get In Touch button, and social icons. Audience links in dropdown use class `dropdown-audience-links`. SVG inside button has `pointer-events: none` to fix click propagation. Scrolled state: **dynamic JS-driven background** that samples the body gradient at the current scroll position, creating a seamless color match (no visible border or hard line). Desktop padding `14px 0 42px`, mobile `10px 0 32px`.

2. **Hero** — Full-viewport with animated intro sequence using **Inspire Change logo** (`Photos/Envision Logo - Inspire Change.png`):
   - Single image with `filter: invert(1)` + `mix-blend-mode: screen` for dark background rendering
   - **Polygon clip-path** used instead of `inset()` to independently control bracket visibility vs "Inspire Change." hiding:
     - Initial: `clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 78%, 60% 78%, 60% 100%, 0 100%)` — L-shaped: full height on left (brackets visible), clips bottom-right (hides "Inspire Change.")
     - Reveal: 78% values animate to 100%, collapsing the notch to show full logo
   - **Phase 1 (0–15%)**: Logo fades in centered, scaled from 0.7→1.0, polygon hides "Inspire Change."
   - **Phase 2 (22–30%)**: Polygon animates to reveal "Inspire Change." tagline
   - **Phase 3**: Gold shimmer sweeps across full logo (`logo-shimmer` 1.75s at 1.63s delay, overlay blend mode)
   - **Phase 4 (56–71%)**: Logo drifts down from center to watermark position above ticker (`top: 50%` → `calc(100% - 65px)`), fades to 6% opacity
   - **Phase 5 (after animation ends)**: JS creates a separate `.inspire-boost` element (cloned logo image with `clip-path: polygon(58% 78%, 100% 78%, 100% 100%, 58% 100%)`) that isolates just the "Inspire Change." text at 0.30 opacity — brighter than the 0.06 watermark but dimmer than normal text. Must be a separate DOM element outside `.hero-logo` because parent opacity (0.06) caps all children.
   - **Hero text** fades in staggered at 4.0s, 4.3s, 4.6s (`hero-text-in` keyframe with scale+translateY)
   - Full animation: 6s `logo-intro` keyframe
   - Tagline: "Fundraising That Inspires Change." (changed from "Moves People"), subtitle, three CTA buttons (Partner With Us, Launch Your Campaign, Join a Team Near You)
   - Background: textured charcoal with vignette, subtle gold glow, faint crosshatch texture
   - Desktop hero padding: `70px 20px 0` (reduced from 100px for better vertical centering)
   - **City ticker** at bottom of hero (not a separate section): gold gradient bar with scrolling city names + year labels (Ottawa 2016, Toronto 2017, Vancouver 2018, Calgary 2020, Edmonton 2021, Halifax 2025, Columbus 2025, Windsor 2025). Bar has `box-shadow` glow for softened edges.
   - **Save states**: `index-new-logo.html` + `style-new-logo.css` preserve the previous [ENVISION] CSS text logo version

3. **Impact Stats** — 4-column grid (12+ Years, 500K+ Donors, 20+ Cities, 10+ Partners). Count-up animation via IntersectionObserver + requestAnimationFrame with ease-out cubic. Full-width curved gold glow bleed from ticker above via `::before` pseudo-element using `radial-gradient(ellipse)`.

4. **Curved Divider: Stats → Locations** — Gold SVG stroke curve (concave up) with horizontal `linearGradient` fading to transparent at edges. Frames the top of the locations section.

5. **Locations Near You** — 8 city cards as `<a href="join.html">` links in a 4-column grid with real photos. Each card has a photo, gradient scrim overlay (`::before` with `:has(img)` selector), and city name label. Cities: Ottawa, Toronto/GTA, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Columbus, Windsor. Background set to `transparent` so body gradient shows through. On **mobile (<=768px)**: converts to a 3D horizontal auto-scrolling carousel (see Mobile Carousel section below).

6. **Curved Divider: Locations → Paths** — Gold SVG stroke curve (convex down) with same horizontal gradient fade. Frames the bottom of the locations section.

7. **Audience Path Cards** — "How Can We Help You?" heading with stationary gold radial glow behind it (`.paths-glow` class, `mix-blend-mode: screen`, 1000x250px ellipse). 3 cards with updated labels and brightened backgrounds (`rgba(255,255,255,0.055)`, border `rgba(255,255,255,0.09)`):
   - For Directors → Partner With Us → `partner.html`
   - For Charities → Launch Your Campaign → `charities.html`
   - For Individuals → Join a Team Near You → `join.html`

8. **Footer** — 4-column grid: brand/tagline (Inspire Change logo image), page links, contact info, social links. Background `transparent` to show body gradient. Gold `border-top` at `rgba(212,168,75,0.15)` for separation. Contact info is placeholder. Homepage footer omits "Home" and "Contact" links. Page links have hover scale effect (`transform: scale(1.16)` with `transform-origin: left center`); contact links excluded from scale via `.footer-contact` class.

### Visual Progression Effects
The homepage uses several layered techniques to create a sense of scroll progression:
- **Body gradient**: Long `linear-gradient` from charcoal (#1C1C2E) through deep navy shades to near-black (#080815). Sections have transparent/minimal backgrounds so the gradient shows through.
- **Gold curved dividers**: Thin gold SVG stroke curves above and below the Locations section. Strokes use horizontal `linearGradient` (transparent → 0.5 opacity gold → transparent) so edges fade naturally with no hard lines.
- **Stationary gold glow**: Radial gradient ellipse behind "How Can We Help You?" heading using `.paths-glow::before` with `mix-blend-mode: screen`.
- **Curved ticker glow**: Full-width `radial-gradient(ellipse)` below the gold ticker bar, creating a curved fade rather than a flat line.
- **Dynamic scrolled nav**: JS samples the body gradient at current scroll position for seamless color matching (no border, no backdrop-filter — just gradient-matched background).

### Removed from Homepage (moved to sub-pages)
- Charity Logo Wall (logos still in `Charity Logos/` folder, not displayed anywhere currently)
- How It Works / About section (content reworked into `about.html`)
- Team Section (moved to `team.html`)
- Testimonials (moved to `about.html`)

## Sub-Pages

### about.html (Complete)
About Us page with dark navy theme matching team/partner pages:
- `<body class="about-page">` for page-specific styling (same navy gradient as team/partner)
- **Page Hero**: "About Envision" heading + mission statement
- **`.about-content-wrapper`**: Wraps all content sections (same pattern as `.team-paths-wrapper` / `.partner-content-wrapper`). Has radial gradient overlays (vignette, gold glow, teal glow) + `::before` navy veil for hero blend.
- **Our Story** (`#our-story`): Intro paragraph + 3 cards (Mission-First, Built Different, Real Impact) using `.about-section` — dark card styling (`rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` background, white headings, grey text)
- **Values** (`.values-section`): Dark theme with `section-heading--light` class, 2x2 grid of values (Integrity, Excellence, People First, Growth) using `.value-item` cards — dark backgrounds with white text
- **Testimonials**: 3 quote cards (Jessica Reynolds, Kai Mitchell, Rachel Morgan — placeholder names/roles)
- **CTA Path Cards**: "Ready to Work Together?" with 3 path cards
- Shared footer + nav with visible nav-links

### team.html (Complete)
Meet the Team page with:
- `<body class="team-page">` for page-specific styling (body-level navy gradient, JS nav color stops)
- **Page Hero**: "Meet the Team" heading
- **`.team-paths-wrapper`**: Wraps both `.team-section` and `.paths-section` in a single div so radial gradient overlays (vignette, gold glow, teal glow) span both sections seamlessly — eliminates the visible seam that occurred when overlays were on separate elements. Both sections have `background: transparent` so the body gradient + wrapper overlays show through.
  - `::before` pseudo-element creates a dark navy veil (200px) that fades the page-hero into the team section
- **Featured Team** (`.team-featured`): Side-by-side photo + bio cards for:
  - John MacInnis — CEO & Founder (real photo: `Photos/John MacInnis.png`)
  - Aidan Hughes — Vice President (real photo: `Photos/Aidan Hughes.jpeg`)
  - Oliver Beatty — Director Liaison & Analytics (real photo: `Photos/Oliver Beatty.png`) — full bio + quote ("Fear in the face of adversity...")
  - Michael Beatty — Payroll & Administration (real photo: `Photos/Micahel Beatty.jpg`) [description placeholder]
  - Megan White — Campaign Coordinator (real photo: `Photos/Megan White.jpg`)
  - Krystal Shannon — Hiring & Communications (real photo: `Photos/Krystal Shannon.jpg`) [description placeholder]
  - Even-numbered cards use `flex-direction: row-reverse` for alternating layout
  - Each has circular photo (200px, gold border), bio text, and italic quote
- **CTA Section**: "Curious About Careers?" with editorial two-column layout (`.team-cta-row`):
  - "For Fundraisers" → Join a Team Near You → `join.html`
  - "For Leaders" → Launch an Office → `partner.html`
  - Gold top border with animated reveal on hover (`::before` width 0→100%)
  - Mobile: stacks single column, leaders first (CSS `order` swap)
- Shared footer + nav with visible nav-links

### partner.html (Complete)
Partner With Us page for fundraising directors:
- `<body class="partner-page">` for page-specific dark navy theme (matches team page)
- **Page Hero**: "Better Pay, More Support, Less Work." + "What's stopping you?"
- **`.partner-content-wrapper`**: Wraps all content sections + CTA (same pattern as `.team-paths-wrapper`). Has radial gradient overlays (vignette, gold glow, teal glow) + `::before` navy veil for hero blend.
- **Two-column details grid** (`.partner-details-grid`): Text left, features right, `align-items: center`
  - **Left column** (`.partner-text-col`): "The deal is simple." heading, lead text, intro paragraph, inline pull-quote blockquote (`.partner-pullquote` — gold left border + warm glow), philosophy paragraphs, "Let's Talk" CTA
  - **Right column** (`.partner-features-panel`): Frosted glass card with gold top border, "What You Get" label, 8-item feature checklist (`.feature-list` with checkmark bullets)
  - Mobile: stacks to single column at 768px

  - "For Charities" → Launch a Campaign → `charities.html`
  - "For Individuals" → Join a Team → `join.html`
- Shared footer + nav with visible nav-links

### charities.html (Placeholder)
"Coming Soon" placeholder page for charity campaign launches:
- `<body class="partner-page">` — reuses dark navy theme
- Construction section with "Launch Your Campaign" heading, "Inspired Changes" tagline, Back to Home + Get In Touch CTAs
- Shared nav + footer

### join.html (Complete)
Interactive city explorer page for team recruitment:
- `<body class="join-page">` — custom dark navy gradient (transitions to dark faster than other pages)
- **Page Hero**: Dual-state hero — landing shows "Join a Team Near You" (Inter 600 weight, off-white) + 5 static team photos from `Photos/Company Team Photos/Join a Team Landing Photos/`. When city selected, hero transforms to city skyline photo with Ken Burns zoom, city name + tagline overlay.
- **`.join-content-wrapper`**: Same radial gradient overlay pattern as partner/team/about pages. `::before` navy veil for seamless hero blend.
- **City Selection Grid** (`.join-explorer`): 8 city cards in 4-column grid (`max-width: 1200px`). Each card: skyline photo, gradient scrim, city name + metadata (region, est. year). Bouncy hover (scale + translateY + gold border glow). Cities: Ottawa (2016), Toronto/GTA (2017), Vancouver (2018), Calgary (2020), Edmonton (2021), Halifax (2025), Columbus (2025), Windsor (2025).
- **City Detail View** (`.join-detail`): Two-column layout — left sidebar (220px sticky) with 7 other city thumbnail cards + "Join a Team Near You" label; right main panel with team info card, 6-photo collage (3x2 grid), Apply Now + View All Cities CTAs.
- **Photo Collage**: 6 generic team photos from `Photos/Company Team Photos/` in 3-column CSS grid (200px rows). Photos cycle every 2.8s with opacity fade animation. 30-second cooldown prevents duplicate photos. Fisher-Yates shuffle for randomized pool.
- **Transitions**: Grid → detail (fade out/up → fade in/up with staggered sidebar + collage entrance). City swap via sidebar (crossfade main panel). Detail → grid via "View All Cities" button.
- **Browser History**: `pushState`/`popstate` for proper back/forward navigation between grid and city states. URL hash deep linking (`#city-ottawa` etc.).
- **CTA Section**: "Looking for Other Opportunities?" with editorial two-column layout (reuses `.team-cta-row`): For Directors → Partner With Us, For Charities → Launch a Campaign.
- **Nav Contrast**: When city photo hero is active, `body.join-city-active` adds heavier text-shadow on nav links and drop-shadow on logo/hamburger for readability over photos.
- Shared footer + nav with visible nav-links

### contact.html (Placeholder)
"Coming Soon" placeholder page for contact:
- `<body class="partner-page">` — reuses dark navy theme
- Construction section with "Get In Touch" heading, Back to Home + Email Us CTAs
- Shared nav + footer

## Navigation — Unified Across All Pages

**Homepage (`index.html`)**:
- Nav has only Inspire Change logo image + hamburger toggle (no visible nav-links)
- Dropdown uses class `dropdown-audience-links` with labels: Partner With Us, Launch Your Campaign, Join a Team Near You

**Sub-pages (about, team, partner, charities, join, contact)**:
- Nav has Inspire Change logo image + visible nav-links (Partner With Us, Launch a Campaign, Join a Team) + hamburger toggle
- Nav-links use `margin-left: auto` to push right; `.nav-links ~ .menu-toggle { margin-left: 0 }` scoped to `@media (min-width: 769px)` so hamburger stays far-right on mobile when nav-links are hidden
- Dropdown panel with full navigation links

## Mobile Hero Layout (<=768px)

The mobile hero uses a different layout strategy from desktop:
- **Hero**: `height: 100dvh`, `padding: 60px 20px 0`, `overflow: hidden`
- **Hero content**: `justify-content: center` with `padding-bottom: 60px` — centers text/buttons vertically
- **Ticker**: `position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; width: 100%` — pinned to bottom of hero, no `100vw` (avoids horizontal overflow on mobile Safari)
- **Important**: Do NOT use `overflow-x: clip` on mobile hero — causes blank ticker on real Safari. Do NOT use `width: 100vw` on mobile ticker — causes horizontal overflow/blank bar on right side.

## Mobile Locations Carousel (<=768px)

The locations grid converts to a 3D horizontal auto-scrolling carousel on mobile:
- Items duplicated in JS for seamless infinite loop
- Auto-scroll at 0.52px/frame
- Loops back when reaching `originalSetWidth + 80` threshold
- Manual swipe override: detects horizontal touch (dx > dy), pauses auto-scroll, resumes 800ms after touchend
- 3D transforms: `rotateY` (±30deg), `translateZ` (-50px at edges), `scale` (1.1 center → 0.7 edges)
- Opacity: 1.0 center → 0.3 edges
- CSS `mask-image` gradient fades edges left/right
- CSS `perspective: 800px` on container, `transform-style: preserve-3d` on items
- Hover transforms disabled on mobile via CSS `!important`
- `reveal-children` stagger overridden with `opacity: 1 !important` so duplicated items are visible

## Key JavaScript Features (script.js)

- **Dynamic nav color**: On scroll > 60px, adds `.scrolled` class and samples the body gradient at the current scroll ratio to set a seamless background color. Uses page-specific gradient stops: navy-based for `body.team-page`, `body.partner-page`, or `body.about-page`; charcoal-based (darkened to match vignette overlay) for homepage/default. Background is a `linear-gradient(to bottom)` that fades to transparent at the bottom edge.
- **"Inspire Change." watermark boost**: After 6.1s (via `setTimeout`, NOT `animationend` — pseudo-element animations bubble and cause double-fire), JS creates a `.inspire-boost` element — a cloned logo image with `clip-path` isolating just "Inspire Change." text — appended to the hero container (not inside `.hero-logo`) so it isn't capped by parent's 0.06 opacity. Uses `getComputedStyle(heroLogo)` to copy the exact computed position (top, left, transform, width) from the hero-logo after its animation fill-mode completes — ensures perfect alignment on both desktop and mobile. Fades in to 0.30 opacity. Includes `querySelector('.inspire-boost')` guard to prevent duplicates.
- **Dropdown panel**: Creates overlay dynamically, open/close with toggle button, closes on overlay click or link click
- **Scroll reveal**: IntersectionObserver with `.reveal` and `.reveal-children` classes, staggered delays via nth-child (up to 12 children). Threshold: 0.05, rootMargin: -20px (lowered from 0.15/-40px for better mobile triggering)
- **Stats counter**: requestAnimationFrame with ease-out cubic curve, triggered by IntersectionObserver
- **Mobile locations carousel**: 3D horizontal auto-scroll with manual touch override
- **City ticker**: Duplicates innerHTML for seamless CSS animation loop

## Key CSS Patterns

- CSS Custom Properties for all design tokens
- Body-level `linear-gradient` for page-wide color drift (sections use transparent backgrounds)
- SVG stroke curves with horizontal `linearGradient` for edge-faded dividers (no hard lines)
- `radial-gradient(ellipse)` for curved glow effects (ticker bleed, paths heading glow)
- `mix-blend-mode: screen` on `.paths-glow::before` for natural gold glow blending
- `:has()` selector for conditional location card styling (gradient scrim when img is present)
- `mask-image` / `-webkit-mask-image` for mobile carousel edge fading
- `perspective` + `transform-style: preserve-3d` for 3D carousel
- `will-change: transform, opacity` for GPU acceleration on carousel items
- `scroll-snap-type: none` on mobile carousel (auto-scroll handles positioning)
- `backdrop-filter: blur()` on dropdown panel
- Scrolled nav: dynamic JS-driven background (no border/blur/shadow — seamless gradient match)
- Hero intro animation: `logo-intro` (6s, polygon clip-path reveal + drift), `logo-shimmer` (1.75s at 1.63s delay), `hero-text-in` (staggered at 4.0–4.6s)
- `clip-path: polygon()` animation for progressive logo reveal — L-shaped polygon hides bottom-right ("Inspire Change.") while keeping left (brackets) fully visible, then collapses notch to reveal
- `filter: invert(1)` + `mix-blend-mode: screen` on hero logo img and nav logo for dark background rendering
- `mix-blend-mode: overlay` for hero logo shimmer effect
- Footer link hover: `transform: scale(1.16)` with `transform-origin: left center`, contact links excluded
- Location cards as `<a>` elements linking to `join.html`
- **Wrapper div pattern** (`.team-paths-wrapper`, `.partner-content-wrapper`): When radial gradient overlays must span multiple sections seamlessly, wrap them in a single parent div with overlays on the parent and all sections set to `background: transparent`. Prevents visible seams at section boundaries (CSS backgrounds are confined to their element's bounding box).
- **Editorial CTA pattern** (`.team-cta-row` / `.team-cta-block`): Two-column grid of link blocks with gold top border that animates to full width on hover via `::before` pseudo-element. Reused on both team.html and partner.html.
- **`.inspire-boost`**: Separate DOM element for selectively boosting opacity of part of a watermark logo. Uses `clip-path: polygon()` to isolate specific text. Must be outside the parent element whose opacity is capped by animation. Position set by JS via `getComputedStyle()` (no static CSS positioning).
- **Wrapper div pattern** also used on about.html (`.about-content-wrapper`) — all three sub-page content areas share the same radial gradient overlay approach.
- Three responsive breakpoints: 1024px (tablet), 768px (mobile), 480px (small mobile)
